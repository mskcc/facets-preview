    <h2>What is the difference between hisens and purity runs?</h2>

    <p>
        Facets-Suite produces two versions for each FACETS run, suffixed in fit data by <code>_purity</code> or <code>_hisens</code>. The primary difference between these runs is the <code>cValue</code> provided for the run. cValue is a smoothing metric that lets FACETS determine when to make breaks between segments.
    </p>

    <p>
        A lower value will result in fewer segment breaks, whereas a higher value will result in a more strict interpretation of the data leading to more breaks. IMPACT repositories by default use values of 100 and 500 respectively for purity and hisens.
