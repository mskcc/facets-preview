    <h2>Can I do refits on my FACETS data?</h2>

    <p>
Performing refits on institutional resources adds refits directly to our data repositories. In order to keep our data clean and high quality, we therefore restrict access to refit functionality when working with institutional resources. While we do want researchers to contribute to refits of institutional repositories, sometimes there are cases where it is desirable to perform refits without altering the institutional data, such as when many experimental refits will need to be performed, or when a new user is learning to use the refit function. In these cases, Facets Preview provides the ability to make personal refits of institutional data.

As this feature will require creating local copies of the data, it is also a restricted operation. Please contact Adam Price (pricea2@mskcc.org)x to request the required password to access to this functionality.
