# Reviewing fits

## 1. Loading facets runs

There two ways to load fits into facets-preview. The first is "repo" mode where samples are input through a manifest file. This file contains at least three columns \(and up to four\). See[ manifest file requirements](input-requirements.md#1-manifest-file). Second option is "sample" mode which simply accepts one or more sample-level facets output directories.

## 2. Samples manifest

The samples manifest page gives a high-level overview of the QC status of the `default` fit as well as that of the reviewed fit \(if it exists\).

## 3. Review fits

### _3.1 Submit refits_

* Refits require the watcher to be running. See [instructions for setting up watcher](installation2.md#5-setup-refit-watcher). If there is a "red cross" it means the watcher is not running. 
* Pre-filled options for all the refit parameters are from the `default` fit \(if there is no `default` fit, then options used to generate any of the fits are used\). Note: the compatible facets versions can be configured in the [config file](installation2.md#4-configuration-file).
* Note: It takes a few mins to generate the refits. Simply, go to the "Samples Manifest" page and click on the sample again to reload with newly generated fits.

### _3.2  QC Summary_

The QC for each fit is generated by an `facets_qc.R` script in the `facets-preview` package \([https://github.com/taylor-lab/facets-preview/tree/master/facets\_qc/](https://github.com/taylor-lab/facets-preview/tree/version_2_preRelease/facets_qc/)\) that is independently version tracked. The purpose is to enable faster evolution of the QC criteria. For more information on QC criteria, see [FACETS QC criteria](facets-qc-criteria.md) section.

The "QC metrics" are simply the aggregation of `facetsSuite::check_fit` metrics as well as the `facets_qc` flags. All columns are also accessible in the sample-level `facets_qc.txt` file.
