    <h2>What exactly are the CF and purity values generated by FACETS?</h2>

    <p>
        The CF value is the cellular fraction of non-diploid cells, which are assumed cancer cells. Purity is reported as the largest CF across the sample, with the assumption that the largest CF within the sample represents a clonal CNA.
    </p>

    <p>For any segment where CF = purity, the CNA on the segment is considered clonal.</p>
